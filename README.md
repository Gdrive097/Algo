## üìù Pull Request Description (you can use this when submitting)

**Title:**  
`feat: add Dijkstra‚Äôs shortest path algorithm + tests`

**Description:**  
This pull request introduces:

- A Python implementation of **Dijkstra‚Äôs shortest path algorithm** in `algorithms/python/dijkstra.py`  
- Unit tests in `algorithms/python/test_dijkstra.py` to validate simple graphs  
- Documentation in `README.md` for usage and how to run tests

**Why this is helpful:**  
- Adds a commonly used graph algorithm to the repository  
- Helps users understand and test the algorithm  
- Improves the breadth of algorithms covered in the repo

**Testing checklist:**  
- Ran `python -m unittest` successfully  
- Verified correct shortest path outputs on simple graph examples  
- README links and instructions are correctly formatted

Please let me know if you‚Äôd like me to include JavaScript or other language versions of this algorithm too, or help with integrating it into the repository‚Äôs structure!
